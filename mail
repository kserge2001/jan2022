c- Run some test and validate the deployment to test environment.
d- Deploy couple apps to production.
e- Establish branching strategy for developers.

 

The project involved migrating developer's code from svn repository to github. This is because github offers more flexibility in terms of building strong, reliable, and scalable CI/CD ( continious integration and  continious delevery) pipeline.
Every code in SVN has a link that can be used to download the code directly.
In jira kanban board, we have tickets. Go ahead and assign tickets to yourself and follow the migration run book to solve those tickets.
